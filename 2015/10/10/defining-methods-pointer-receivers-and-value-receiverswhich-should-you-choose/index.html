<p>Many people are scared of pointers when they first get started in Go, especially if they&rsquo;re coming to Go from dynamic languages that don&rsquo;t expose the concept. Even after they&rsquo;ve gotten a good grasp on what pointers are and how they work, many new gophers feel a bit anxious about when they should be defining a method on a value rather than a pointer.</p>

<p>The Go team has given a good set of guidelines in their <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#methods_on_values_or_pointers">FAQ</a>, listing three basic considerations.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Modification</strong>: If you need to modify the receiver, then it must be a pointer.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: If your value is large, use a pointer.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Don&rsquo;t mix pointer / value receivers for a given type.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are exceptions, but starting with these guidelines as a rule of thumb will get you pretty far.</p>

<p>Another excellent resource when it comes to making the decision about pointer vs value receivers is the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#receiver-type">Code Review Comments wiki page</a> on the golang/go project on GitHub. It has a section about receiver types, which you should absolutely go read. It concludes with <em>when in doubt, use a pointer receiver</em>.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-you-ever-use-a-non-pointer-receiver:d50cffd73db67296e192c311b4a1600b">Why Would You Ever Use a Non-Pointer Receiver?</h2>

<p>When the receiver is a map or a slice you will almost always want to use a value receiver for these. Almost. Maps and slices act as references. <a href="http://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals">Go Slices: Usage and Internals</a> on the official Go blog is a fantastic deep dive into slices, and you should go read it if you haven&rsquo;t already, in order to understand why you occasionally will want to use a pointer receiver for a slice.</p>

<p>Aside from types that act as references, the most common case for defining a value receiver rather than a pointer receiver is when you are defining a small struct type that acts as a value. The term <em>value</em> here might be a bit confusing, because this &ldquo;value&rdquo; is not the same &ldquo;value&rdquo; as in <em>value receiver vs. pointer receiver</em>.</p>

<p>This is about identity.</p>

<p>If you have two values of a given type, and all their fields have the same values in them, do they represent the same thing?</p>

<p>Sometimes the answer is yes. For example, 2:15pm is 2:15pm, provided that they&rsquo;re both in the same timezone. You might have a bunch of copies of this value, each copy might live in a different place in memory, but they&rsquo;re all equivalent.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t always the case. For example you could have two people, both named Bob Smith, and both born on the same day. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re the same person, as anyone married to a Bob Smith can attest to. You can&rsquo;t just trade one Bob Smith for another.</p>

<p>Dates, times, points, vectors, web-safe colors are all typically small, and their identity is based on their value.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s idiomatic in Go to define a value receiver rather than a pointer receiver for these types.</p>

<p>Some people ask: <em>Isn&rsquo;t it always more efficient to use a pointer receiver?</em></p>

<p>Two answers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nope.</li>
<li>You profiled, right?</li>
</ol>

<p>A pointer receiver introduces indirection. In some cases this indirection has a measurable cost.</p>

<p>&gt; The problem most people have, is that they try to make this decision based on what they think the performance tradeoff will be. – William Kennedy, <a href="http://www.goinggo.net/2014/12/using-pointers-in-go.html">Using Pointers in Go</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s far better to make choices based on what is simple and idiomatic, than on some pre-conceived idea of what will perform well.</p>

<p>To quote the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RulesOfOptimization">Rules of Optimization</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>The First Rule of Optimization: Don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>The Second Rule of Optimization: Don&rsquo;t… yet.</li>
<li>Profile before optimizing.</li>
</ol>
